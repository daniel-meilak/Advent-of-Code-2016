## Day 11

Probably the hardest Advent of Code question I've attempted. The nature of the question meant that I was completely unaware of how to solve the problem so I had to look online for explanations and solutions however ever after staring at various solutions in different languages I was basically none the wiser. The funny thing about it is that I read over and over how a breadth first search can be used to solve the question however I thought I didn't know how to implement this or how it worked. In actual fact, I had looked up and understood how to use this algorithm from a previous (AoC 2020) question I had attempted. 

The bulk of the problem was writing an object oriented based solution to the problem. I am still quite unfamiliar with how ooc should work together and so my coding style here was probably quite sub-par. 

Using optimization, part 1 and part 2 finish in around 40 seconds.
