## Day 9

Difficult question. day_9.cpp contains implementation for part 1. 

day_9v2 contains implementation for part2 from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/5hbygy/2016_day_9_solutions/dazentu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). While this implementation does not work for part 1, its speed for part 2 is excellent.

day_9v3 contains another implementation from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/5hbygy/2016_day_9_solutions/daz279z?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for part 1 and 2. Part 2 using this method still takes a considerable amount of time, around 30s.

Both implementations were translated to C++ from python or a pseudocode explanation.
